# Overtime Code Exercise Instructions
Hi Alexandra! Congratulations on making it to the next step in the process. For this exercise please use this React boilerplate to create an application that allows a user to create and edit an inventory of books.

Your application should:
- Allow a user to add a new book to their inventory with a title, author, ISBN, and cover image.
- Allow a user to search in their books by title.
- If you have additional time, allow a user to update fields for an existing book.

This isn’t a design exercise, but I would like to see a modern library like Bootstrap, Chakra, Tailwind, etc. implemented to make it look a little nice, and definitely follow UX best practices to make the app usable. **Data should persist across page reloads**, but you can use local storage, i.e., no need to spin up a server or use a database.

If you have any questions or would like me to hop on the GitPod session with you please let me know! 

Once complete, just shoot me an email and I'll pop in and take a look at the session. 

P.S. As I mentioned before, one of the cool things about GitPod is that you can actually work out of your local VS Code IDE and the changes sync to the cloud in real-time. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
